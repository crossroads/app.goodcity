## Running Tests

* `npm test`

## Building

* `npm build`
* `EMBER_CLI_CORDOVA=0 ember build --environment=production`

## Deployment

Staging site

`npm run deploy-staging`

Live site

`npm run deploy-live`

Note you will need to have your SSH key installed on the destination servers before deployment will work.

## Upgrading Ember CLI

Follow these steps to update the project version of ember-cli.
If someone else has done the upgrade and you're just refreshing code ignore the SKIP lines.

```shell
npm uninstall -g ember-cli
npm cache clean
bower cache clean
rm -rf node_modules bower_components dist tmp
npm install -g ember-cli
npm install --save-dev ember-cli (SKIP if someone else has updated ember-cli already)
npm link shared.goodcity
ember init (SKIP if someone else has updated ember-cli already)
ember install
```

## Cordova

### Setup
* `npm install -g cordova` (note 5.1.1 has problems installing plugins from git url on windows use 5.0.0 instead)
* `ember cordova:prepare` (mainly needed to create symlink between dist <=> cordova/www)
* `cd cordova`
* `cordova prepare android` (or ios/windows)

Android
* Install stand alone SDK tools - https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html
* set environment variables<br/>
  `export ANDROID_HOME=/<installation location>/android-sdk`<br/>
  `export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`
* start SDK manager from terminal `android`
  - install "Android 5.1.1 (API 22)/SDK Platform"
  - install "Tools/Android SDK Build-tools" (latest version)
  - install "Tools/Android SDK Platform-tools" (latest version)
* `sudo apt-get install ant`

Android Emulator setup (not needed if using a real phone)
* start SDK manager from terminal `android`
  - install "Android 5.1.1 (API 22)/Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image"
* open from menu "Tools > Manage AVDs > Create"
* fill out create new AVD and click ok

Windows Phone
* Install Visual Studio - https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/cordova-vs.aspx
* During install under optional features tick "Apache Cordova" (or look to install Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova)
* Register your phone by using the "Windows Phone Developer Registration Tool"

IOS
* Install Xcode - https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/
* Ask to be signed up as a developer of the Crossroads Apple Developer Team
* In XCode download the certs via "Settings > Accounts > View Details > Refresh"
* Register your phone under https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/deviceList.action
* `npm install -g ios-deploy`

### Run
To start app in emulator

`ember cordova emulate android`

To deploy to connected device

`ember cordova run windows -- --phone --device` (WP8.1)<br/>
`ember cordova run android --device`<br/>
`ember cordova run ios --device`

---

To deploy to Android you need to have USB debugging enabled, to do so:

* enable `settings > developer options > android debugging`

If developer options is missing:

* go to `settings > about phone`
* tap `build number` seven times

For Android you can use Chrome for remote debugging of the app on your phone:
https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging

For iOS you can use Safari and under develop menu to remotely debug app on iPhone.

For Windows Phone you can use Visual Studio to deploy app and debug by opening `platforms/windows/CordovaApp.Phone.jsproj`.

Note if you are using an IDE (e.g. XCode/VisualStudio/AndroidStudio) then after running `ember build` to make code changes, you'll need to run `cordova build <platform>` before deploying so that `cordova/www` is copied to `cordova/platforms/<platform>/www`.

### Build
Release Build

`ember cordova:build --environment=production --platform=<android|wp8|ios|windows>`

Debug Build
```sh
cd cordova
ember build --environment=production
cordova build android --debug
```

For Android release build it needs to be manually signed (key not in repo):
http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#signing-manually

### Other Commands
`ember cordova <arguments>`
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html

## Development Notes

* Cordova loads app like "file://www/index.html" so can't use "/assets" or "//domain.com" style relative paths. In website mode even though the current url might be `goodcity.hk/offers/1/items` ember adds a `<base href'/'>` tag so urls in templates are still relative from the root (in cordova mode config.locationType is set to hash i.e. `goodcity.hk/#/offers/1/items` and no base tag is added).

* CustomAsynchelper for MockAjax call is mockApi, example to show how to use it:
  ```js
    mockApi('get', '/route_name', {json:data})
  ```
  Example on how to use it with FactoryGuy
  ```js
    mockApi('get',
              '/territories',
              {territories: FactoryGuy.buildList('territory_with_many_districts', 3)});
  ```

* To keep whitespace settings consistent in source code we're using .editorconfig which can be installed in your favourite editor via http://editorconfig.org/#download

* Shared brocfile imports can be found in shared.goodcity/index.js
